Welcome to my personal portfolio website! My name is Frank, and I am an enthusiastic and fast-learning data scientist with 4 years of hands-on experience in machine learning. My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as C++, Python, and R, and I am experienced in working with cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP. I have also worked with tools like Flask, Github, and Linux and have knowledge of databases such as MySQL and Firestore.

I have successfully completed several AI/ML projects using frameworks such as Pytorch, Tensorflow, BERT, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. One of my notable projects is Athena, which won the [Axxess Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/athena-ib3mfr). In this project, I implemented Firebase and Flask base backend server to support API requests interaction, and augmented user query information by 25% using Roberta sentiment analysis to detect patients’ negative emotions. I also integrated OpenAI ChatGPT into voice-to-text Whispir service to achieve over 90% satisfaction in judges’ selection.

Apart from this, I have also worked as a Data Scientist in Taiwan, where I built up data pipelines and integrated web crawling with a MySQL database to collect over 3000 news articles. I developed an auto-processing model using PageRank keyword model for convenient access to a 10 member team, and clustered industry news to extract trending events using unsupervised learning methods: LDA, HDBSCAN. I have also worked as a mentor at the Artificial Intelligence Society, University of Texas at Dallas, where I led a team of five undergraduate students to build an NLP-based Youtube video summarizer as a Chrome extension.

I am currently seeking a challenging internship opportunity in a progressive company to utilize my modeling and analytics skills to create value. Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio website, and I look forward to working with you!
