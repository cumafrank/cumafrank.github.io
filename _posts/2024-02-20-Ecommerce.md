## Introduction

In this project, I dive deep into e-commerce data to extract actionable insights, which could significantly impact business strategies and customer engagement. The following document outlines the key findings from our analysis, supported by visual data representations.

## City-Wise Analysis

Our city-wise analysis highlighted distinct spending patterns across different regions. Sydney outperforms Melbourne in both the total order price and the number of orders. Interestingly, the average order value is higher in Melbourne, suggesting a strategy that might focus on higher-value items there, while volume sales could be the focus in Sydney.


## Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** is crucial for understanding long-term business sustainability. Our analysis identified customers with high CLV, suggesting a need for targeted retention strategies and personalized engagement to maintain these valuable relationships.


## Customer Segmentation Analysis

By segmenting customers, we could identify distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. This segmentation allows for more focused marketing strategies, tailored product recommendations, and personalized customer experiences.

## Order Priority Analysis

Investigating the impact of order priority levels on delivery time revealed that orders with higher priority statuses tend to be delivered faster. This finding emphasizes the importance of a responsive supply chain that can adapt to varying customer needs.


## Product Performance Analysis

Our product performance analysis provided insights into which products are the top performers in terms of sales and margins. This information is vital for inventory management, guiding decisions on stock levels, and potential promotions or discontinuations.

## Yearly Sales Trends

A review of yearly sales trends shows a fluctuation in order totals, the number of orders, and the number of unique customers over the years. These trends are essential for forecasting and planning marketing efforts, as well as for preparing inventory for expected demand.


## Conclusion

The e-commerce dataset analysis has shed light on several key areas that can influence business decisions. From city-wise spending habits to customer lifetime value and product performance, the insights gained can help tailor strategies to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction. The importance of adapting to customer needs is evident, particularly in managing order priorities and understanding the impact on delivery times. This analysis underscores the potential of data-driven strategies in the competitive landscape of e-commerce.
